## ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS ACROSS CONTINENTS AND COUNTRIES
**Power BI**
### INTRODUCTION
Development indicators are measurable characteristics or variables used to assess the level of development or progress of a country, region, or community. These indicators provide insights into various aspects of socio-economic well-being and quality of life. They help policymakers, researchers, and organizations to understand the current state of development, track changes over time, and identify areas that require attention or improvement.
In this analysis we will be focusing on three types of development indicators; economic, social and environmental across 5 continents and 162 countries in the year 1980. The data under scrutiny was collected during the months of May, June, and July.
#### Economic development indicator
**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: GDP is a measure of the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders within a specific time period, usually annually or quarterly. It is a key indicator of the economic health and size of a nation's economy. A higher GDP typically indicates a stronger economy with more wealth and resources available for its citizens.
#### Social Development Indicator
**Life Expectancy:** Life expectancy is the average number of years a person is expected to live based on current mortality rates. It is a crucial indicator of the overall health and well-being of a population. Higher life expectancy generally reflects better access to healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and overall living conditions.
**Child Mortality Rate per 1000 Births:** Child mortality rate, often expressed as the number of deaths of children under the age of five per 1,000 live births, is a measure of the number of children who die before reaching the age of five. It is a key indicator of the quality of healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and socio-economic conditions in a country. Lower child mortality rates typically indicate better access to healthcare and improved living standards.
#### Environmental Development Indicator
**CO2 Emissions per person (Tonnes):** CO2 emissions per person measures the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per capita in a given area, usually measured in metric tons per person per year. It is an important indicator of a country's contribution to climate change and its environmental impact. Higher emissions per capita indicate greater reliance on fossil fuels and less sustainable development practices.
 
### FINDINGS
#### GDP per Capita Analysis:
The **top 5** countries with the highest GDP per capita, as depicted on the bar chart, include **Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Luxembourg,** and **Saudi Arabia**. Conversely, the countries with the **lowest** recorded GDP per capita, observed from the bar chart, are **Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mozambique, Timor-Leste**, and **South Sudan**.
#### Child Mortality Rate Analysis:
Among the **top 5** countries with the highest average child mortality rates are **Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, Guinea,** and **Burkina Faso**. Conversely, **Iceland, Sweden, Croatia, Slovenia,** and **Andorra** demonstrate the **least average child mortality rates**.
#### CO2 Emissions Observations:
Reviewing the column chart, countries like **Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Luxembourg,** and **Bahrain** exhibit the **highest CO2 emissions per person**. Conversely, **Mali, Timor-Leste, Chad, Burundi,** and **South Sudan** rank **lowest in CO2 emissions per person**.
#### Average Life Expectancy Insights:
Examining the map visualization, it's notable that overall average life expectancy among countries appears relatively consistent. However, **Switzerland** emerges with the **highest life expectancy** at **77 years**, while **Mali** exhibits the **lowest life expectancy** at **47 years**.
#### Life Expectancy and Child Mortality Rate by Continent:
As depicted by the line and column chart, a clear trend emerges: higher life expectancy corresponds with lower child mortality rates across the 5 continents. Notably, **Europe** demonstrates high life expectancy and low child mortality rates, while **Africa** exhibits the opposite pattern.
#### Correlation Analysis:
Scatter plots reveal interesting relationships:
•	A positive relationship is evident between CO2 emissions and GDP per capita.
•	A positive relationship is observed between CO2 emissions and life expectancy, indicating that higher CO2 emissions coincide with higher life expectancy.
•	Surprisingly, a negative trend line is observed between CO2 emissions and child mortality rate, suggesting that higher CO2 emissions may coincide with lower child mortality rates, although this relationship is not straightforward.
•	Similarly, a negative trend line is observed between GDP per capita and child mortality rate, with data points clustered around the axes.

### ANALYSIS
Based on the findings presented, several key analyses can be formed:
#### Economic Disparities and Environmental Impact: 
There exists a clear correlation between countries' GDP per capita and their CO2 emissions. Wealthier nations tend to have higher levels of carbon emissions, likely due to industrialization and greater energy consumption. This underscores the challenge of balancing economic development with environmental sustainability.
#### Health Disparities Across Regions: 
Disparities in life expectancy and child mortality rates are evident across continents. Countries with higher GDP per capita generally exhibit higher life expectancy and lower child mortality rates, highlighting the importance of socio-economic factors in determining health outcomes. Regions like Europe demonstrate better health indicators compared to Africa, where developmental challenges persist.
#### Complex Relationships between Development Indicators: 
The relationships between development indicators such as GDP per capita, CO2 emissions, life expectancy, and child mortality rates are multifaceted and not always straightforward. While economic prosperity may contribute to higher life expectancy, it can also lead to higher carbon emissions. Surprisingly, there appears to be a negative relationship between CO2 emissions and child mortality rates, suggesting the need for further exploration of underlying factors.
#### Policy Implications: 
These analyses have implications for policy formulation and intervention strategies. Efforts to promote sustainable development must address the interconnectedness of economic growth, environmental conservation, and public health. Policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions should consider socio-economic factors and prioritize equitable development to improve health outcomes for all populations.
Overall, these analyses highlight the complexity of global development dynamics and underscore the importance of holistic approaches in addressing the interconnected challenges of economic growth, environmental sustainability, and public health

 **Property Types:** Commercial, Single Family, Public Utility, Industrial, Apartments, Four Family, Three Family, Two Family, Vacant Land, Condo, Residential, and NA
Residential Types: Condo, Four Family, Three Family, Two Family, Single Family, and NA

### Key Findings

#### 1. Town with the Most Listings
   - **East Hartford**, located in Hartford County, Connecticut, has emerged as the town with the highest number of property listings. This high volume of listings could be attributed to various factors such as the town's real estate market dynamics, economic activities, or housing demands. Following East Hartford, **Glastonbury** also shows a significant number of property listings, making it another key area of interest for real estate activities.

#### 2. Property and Residential Type with the Highest Average Sales Ratio
   - Analysis indicates that **Single Family** homes have the highest average sales ratio among both property and residential types. This suggests that single-family homes are highly valued and sought after, likely due to their desirability for buyers looking for standalone residential units, which offer privacy and often come with land. The high sales ratio could also reflect the market’s strong demand for single-family homes compared to other property types.

#### 3. Most Profitable Towns by Property Type
 **Greenwich** stands out as the most profitable town for residential listings. This profitability can be linked to Greenwich's reputation for upscale living, high-end properties, and affluent residents. Greenwich's strong real estate market likely benefits from its desirable location, excellent amenities, and quality of life, making it a lucrative area for real estate investments. This town’s high profitability underscores its significance as a prime location for both buyers and investors looking for high returns.

#### 4. Towns with the Highest Mean Assessed Value
**Greenwich** not only tops the list for profitability but also for the highest average assessed property values, followed closely by **New Canaan**, **Darien**, and **Westport**. These towns are known for their luxurious properties, strong local economies, and high standards of living. The high assessed values in these towns indicate that properties are likely to command high market prices, reflecting the overall affluence and desirability of these locations. Such areas are often considered prime targets for real estate development and investment.

#### 5. Relationship Between Assessed Value and Sales Amount
   - The scatterplot analysis reveals a clear positive correlation between assessed property values and sales amounts. This trend indicates that properties with higher assessed values tend to sell for higher amounts, reinforcing the idea that more valuable properties (in terms of assessment) are perceived to be worth more in the market. This relationship can be useful for predicting sales prices based on assessed values, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding property investments and pricing strategies.

#### 6. Trend Analysis
   - The trend analysis of real estate listings from 1999 to 2022 highlights significant fluctuations in the market. Initially, there was a period of rapid growth, peaking around the early 2000s, followed by a sharp decline during the financial crisis of 2008. The market then experienced a period of stabilization from 2009 to 2016, with listings remaining relatively steady. A moderate increase in listings was observed from 2016 to 2020, reflecting gradual economic recovery and improved market conditions. However, the recent years have shown a sharp decline in listings, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted market dynamics. These trends highlight the real estate market's sensitivity to broader economic events and underscore the importance of understanding market cycles for strategic planning and investment.
